# Text-Recognition-By-Air-Drawing
The text drawn by the user is captured by the computer's camera, followed by the identification of that text. (January 2021 - April 2021)

It aims toward handwriting recognition to create a trained CNN model that recognizes gestures written in the air as text.

Model users would be able to write characters in the air facing a web camera in real-time and those ges-tures will be transformed into text.

Technologies used: Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
